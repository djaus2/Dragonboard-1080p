# Dragonboard-1080p
Enable a Qualcomm DragonBoard 410c to use 1920x1080 instead of 1280x720 as display resolution when running Windows 10 IoT-Core

**1080p** (1920x1080 px; also known as full HD or FHD and BT.709) is a set of HDTV high-definition video modes characterized by 1080 horizontal lines of vertical resolution;[1] the p stands for progressive scan, i.e. non-interlaced. The term usually assumes a widescreen aspect ratio of 16:9, implying a resolution of 2.1 megapixels. It is often marketed as full HD, to contrast 1080p with 720p resolution screens.
*From Wikipedia*

The **Qualcomm DragonBoard 410c** Windows 10 IoI-Core image only supports 1280x720 screen resolution. It has been noted that is possible to modify the BSP so as to support the higher resolution 1080p. Whist it might be a simple as making some modification to the OS as distributed, or to run an app, it seems that a rebuild of the BSP is required. Whether this can be done in a public manner (you have to be registered to get tyeh BSP source) remains to be seen.

## In Brief
It has been suggested that the ACPI table in the BSP need modification.
